    "I don't disagree. These troubled people exist, and they are a serious problem, but as an individual, this is just not a problem you can address by buying a gun to protect yourself. Using a gun to protect yourself makes it MORE likely that you will die, not less.\n\nIt's okay to feel scared by these people. I certainly don't blame you, and I am scared of them too. But the existence of such people are a societal problem, so they must be primarily dealt with by enacting changes to public policy. As such, IMO the biggest problem facing us right now is having a government that only cares about enabling businesses to make more profit, even at the expense of people's welfare. We can have a govt that does both, of course, but we are quickly reaching a point where our society will fall apart if something doesn't give soon.\n\nThat aside, I'm reminded of when the GOP actually started advocating for more gun control when the Black Panthers began demonstrably exercising their right to own guns in the 70s. The point was supposed to be to make a show of force so that people would think twice about messing with you, but that effect was short-lived. The far-right propaganda machine jumped at the chance to instead start portraying black people as thugs and criminals in order to justify police crackdowns on black communities, and the media got in on the hype by creating an entire era of indoctrinating people with this propaganda using TV and film that glorifies the police as heroes protecting the common man, like Dirty Harry, CHiPs, Starsky and Hutch, TJ Hooker, etc.",

    "I'm glad these movements are starting to gain momentum. I understand not wanting to manufacture parts directly for old hardware anymore, but it frustrates me that companies can't come up with better ways to make their products sustainable and repairable, when they are so blindsided by trying to sell a new product to get another dollar. The repair industry is huge, and gestures of good faith towards it are what the world needs, not to mention, what businesses needed to be steady business, not rapid growth then hard crash businesses like what we see.\n\nDuring the pandemic, especially at the Start of it, I saw a large influx of computer hardware coming in with damaged screens, swollen batteries, and bad keyboards, made by a particular fruit company. I personally have no problem with taking apart products like these and doing repairs - I've been doing it since Age 7, and taught myself how to do it safely, and how to dispose of broken parts in an environmentally friendly way (my town has eWaste collection as part of the disposal taxes). As these devices came in, I couldn't even buy parts for the products directly from the manufacturer, and most of the local computer shops were shut down as they reworked their procedures to handle the COVID precautions. Manufacturer repairs were at least a couple weeks turn-around, even for a job I could complete in 5 minutes. Besides, I didn't want to increase the cross contamination risk that comes with shipping hardware to a place to be repaired, nor do I want to increase the carbon footprint of a product by shipping it around six or more times when it could simply be shipped around twice. Even better, if a product was designed to be field serviceable, the risk to myself could've also been greatly reduced.\n\nThen there are other issues, too. For example, a popular electric car company recently came out saying they're repair friendly because they share product information with the community, but they don't allow consumers to perform repairs outside of dealerships because of security reasons. The first thing I thought of when I heard that was of the product design. If security was such an issue, why is it the product has an unremovable cellular radio that, if removed, causes the product to stop working? Security here, clearly isn't to save the consumer, but is to ensure the product can be locked down if a software feature was included on accident, or, simply insert another reason here. Sure, I get there are other features of the product that mandate the cellular radio, like maps and such. But those can just as easily be offloaded to a smartphone like any automobile with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Then there's the other issue with said popular electric car company. I may be able to buy one of their cars, but if my battery pack needs changing because of how rough our winters are on Lithium batteries, there is no shop within 300 miles in my own country that has access to the first party parts. The nearest dealership is in another country. Literally the only thing I can buy for said product, are tires and brakes, so if the product breaks down or, say, my ECU bricks because of bad eMMC flash, the tow bill even with insurance coverage will be insane.\n\nAt this point, it's frustrating to even hear these companies speak, as you know just how full of crap they are. Once a product is sold, the company shouldn't have a say in what someone does with it.",

Thousands upon thousands of people die in this country because they either don\u2019t have health insurance, don\u2019t have *adequate* health insurance, or are frankly just scared shitless about the obscene medical bills that this country allows its citizens to be crushed under, and thus make a conscious decision to avoid going to the hospital. \nThis is a disgusting, neo-stone age society in my mind. \n\nYes, we need our legislatures to pass these right to repair laws. But when we\u2019re living through a pandemic, as a country which has no universal healthcare system, or really just no *functional* healthcare system at the very least, and as a country whose government provides absolutely NO economic relief for its people during these *continuously stacking crises* of historic and horrific proportions, it\u2019s hard to ask for the government to do something so specific.

    "So this is the opposite side of the problem:\n\nTesla disables cars that have modded software when they detect it. This seems like a horrible idea. But the point they're trying to make is that they have all of their advanced controls and autopilot stuff in the car. If something were to go wrong with your \"hacked\" or custom software and autopilot kills someone, the news and anyone looking at the crash will just see a tesla crashing itself. Similar reasoning can be applied to the farm equipment that started this movement. \n\nSo now the obvious: we should be able to fix things ourselves. But the more advanced features that aren't purely mechanical fixes (more in a bit) should be a removable black box. Autopilot from tesla? Have a component in the glove box that you can remove. Farm equipment? Standard PLC access (also worth explaining) but anything more advanced should be locked into its own rack module, and disabled if it's not there. \n\n**Purely Mechanical Features** - I'm not saying cars need to go back to carburetors, so things like the ECU should be standard electronics that can be modified like tuning shops do. \n\n**Standard PLC access** - I work in automation and you can do a lot with a PLC (programmable logic controller). It's the brains for most factories and it has several programming languages, one of which is **ladder logic** which was designed to work like actual wiring so electricians could understand the program. Most of my clients had access to change the program, but we also had some advanced control methods that we made very locked down. We told the customer what gets connected to the virtual black box and they would not change that. This model works perfectly because simple things like adding a pump to the factory floor can be done by a technician working at the factory, and didn't require someone from my company coming to do minor work (though usually they had us do it anyway, because we had a guarantee on out programming). \n\nSo right to repair? Hell yes. Right to every feature? Understandably no. This also opens up the possibility of mod chips so if you're BMW and tie the heated seats to a subscription of your advanced set, people can easily buy a chip to get around it.",

    "This article has a shit source to claim that conservative censorship bias is baseless.\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, where FactCheck.org is based, explained that to truly assess bias, you have to establish a data set (i.e., pieces of content), find comparable content on the left and the right, and then see if they were treated the same. This has to be done multiple times. Jamieson and other scholars have successfully conducted these analyses on print media and\u00a0cable news, and found there is generally bias on both sides, although\u00a0not one overwhelming \"liberal media\" bias.\nDoing the same for social media, however, is a different story. There is simply too much data. And these social networks aren't necessarily open to outside researchers poking under the hood. There are privacy concerns, and it could jeopardize company secrets.\n\n\u201cFrom a methodological standpoint, it\u2019s virtually impossible to do,\u201d Jamieson said. \u201cYou'll never capture the full base of the content in order to start your analysis.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDoing the same for social media, however, is a different story. There is simply too much data. And these social networks aren't necessarily open to outside researchers poking under the hood. There are privacy concerns, and it could jeopardize company secrets.\n\n*Literally stating in thier own article that it was too complicated for them to debunk, which is false. evidence is evidence, be it anecdotal, empirical, statistical or russian... Or did we forget about the mattress and the collusion \"scandal\" that saw round the clock coverage for months?\n\nThen last year, the Trump campaign solicited complaints of social media \u201ccensorship,\u201d but that was basically just a way to\u00a0get voter emails and donations. A Columbia research fellow\u00a0did his own analysis\u00a0on high-profile figures banned by Twitter, and found they were mostly Trump supporters. Many of them \u2014 David Duke and Richard Spencer, just to name two \u2014 also happened to be white supremacists spreading hate speech.\n\n*Hate speech is an intentionally ambiguous term designed to shift its definition at a moments notice any time it needs to narrow our freedom of speech. Who defines hate speech? Anybody? Everybody?\n\nThat's related to another issue: people on the right may in fact experience more content moderation than people on the left because right-leaning ideologies and content overlap with behavior that\u2019s not allowed on social networks.\n\n*whew. Wow. Let me shake off the stink of browncoat real fast before i hop into this one. It's because these social networks are owned and ran by leftists who alligned their CG with leftists ideals. Of course this would lead to an \"overlap\" with behavior the tech companies dont like, namely, any behavior that may hope to jeopardize Biden's campaign, and since the left supports Biden, they happily support the suppression, assuming it wont happen to them, assuming they will be protected by their collective they traded all of their liberties off to.

    "people conflating money laundering with terrorism is often due to intentional mislabelling, or the government making baseless assertions of terrorist ties.\n\nthe government loves to imply that money launderers are all either drug cartels or terrorists, because it helps them whip up enough outrage to stop people from thinking too carefully about it.  \"you don't want us to make it harder to open bank accounts, why do you love terrorists so much?!\" gets people to shut up and go along even when what they want to do, even as it creates more \"unbanked\" people and makes it harder for poor people to live, to say nothing of the fact it quite intentionally makes nontraditional banking and community banking much harder if not impossible, and empowers the government to use civil forfeiture against those people widely.\n\nnow I'm not saying no terrorists launder money, and obviously criminal gangs have always been money launderers, it's not the #1 though, that would by far and away be corrupt officials (especially in China and Russia) hiding their loot, as well as other foreign kleptocrats who want a place to stash their money away from prying eyes, #2 is tax evasion and asset hiding.  But if you say \"terrorist terrorist terrorist cartel\" you can make it so no one says \"wait what about the collateral damage?\"\n\nof course in this case I don't really care much about the collateral damage but we should all be wary of \"don't let the terrorists win\" being used to justify anything.",

Giving people the right to repair is nice, but it needs to become mandatory for devices to be repaired or recycled by the manufacturer. Otherwise they'll just make repairing possible but insanely difficult. Getting the class action lawsuit together will take years. Then it'll be stalled out in court for years more.
