Quitting/cutting back always comes with failed attempts and drawbacks but don't let that stop you. You may find that once you've stopped for a while you're better equipped to deal with stressors in your life. I always thought I needed it for sleep and no doubt my sleep schedule was off for a while after I quit daily smoking. After a while though because I stopped and found discipline again I was excersing and sleeping well. I can tell you sleeping without it is a way higher quality of sleep. I don't think I ever felt rested when I smoked daily. Weed \"hangovers\" are a thing. \n\nI think if your life revolves around it and its become a personality trait its time to dial it back. It should only ever be an enhancer. \n\nfunny enough i still grow weed even though I barely smoke, makes for a great gifts lol I still have friends that smoke daily. its not like there was this massive upheaval when I cut back. like I had to cut people out or find out who I was again. It was literally only positives. its like I just became more of myself and I had more time on my hands. the few hours at the end of the day became productive hours again where I could do something for myself.",

    "no worries my dude. They may stere you to quitting all together but its never a bad idea to take a few months off. I never smoke more then once a month now. I started at 14 as well. was a daily toker for at least 12 years. I never knew how much it affected me until it started causing anxiety attacks. I was always one of those people that maintained it was no worse then caffeine. once I stopped for a few months I actually found it to be the root of ALL my paranoia, depression anxiety and cognitive decline. I got better at my job, my physical and mental health improved. I stopped eating take out, my house was cleaner, my relationships improved, it was easier to socialize with strangers. When I stopped smoking daily its like a fog was lifted from my brain. I cant imagine how it affected my developing brain but I don't think about it. No doubt I'd be different. \n\nThe less you smoke and the more your tolerance goes down the more you realise what an effect it can have. Especially when you keep your stoner friends around and start noticing their lack of memory and quick critical thinking skills. I recommend shooting for a month off to start. Tell yourself you can try it again after a month so you're more likely to make it through. When you try it again after a month of not smoking you may find it less attractive or at the very least you'll need a lot less lol Or you may realise you were looking forward to it waaay to much and maybe thats a problem. \n\nall these cats tell me \"I can stop anytime\" but they never do and give you a reason why they don't need to. thats an addiction lol we humans can rationalise just about anything. Here's a good thought experiment, if you were to replace a unit of your cannabis intake with a 2 litre of cola would it be a healthy habit? I mean sugar is pretty innocuous, the body could handle 2L of pop in one sitting. But if you did that morning and night for years better believe it would have some serious repercussions.",

If i didn't have so many other games to get through it could easily engulf me. \nTo be totally honest, Dark Souls feels like a rite of passage to me in a lot of ways. Without getting into too much detail, I'm moving my life in a positive direction. Dark Souls feels like I'm fighting my own demons. Having beat Midir totally sober and not having the urge to get high afterwards was a turning point. Before I wanted to crawl into bed and shut out the world because without weed, what's the point?!

Most people I know (In the UK) who smoke weed rarely ever never ever smoke from a bong.\n\nThe ones who are down in the dumps just smoke an endless line of spliffs and I think, that the high is different, it burns through your stash quicker, and if you spend a lot of money on weed, it makes you feel worse overall so you buy more etc.\n\nIt's a vicious circle.\n\nI grind a big of a nug, have a cool little pill pot with the ground flower. Tiny antique spoon, not unlike the kind used for cocaine, and i scoop a bit into a bowl and bong away.\n\nI maybe have 5 small bowls a day? Top it up as I go along. Don't mix tobacco with it, it's a free way to get even higher if you have a cigarette after smoking just weed.\n\nIt so sounds corny but I really do find if people didn't think of it as just a \"drug\" and maybe had a bit of a deeper nature respect for it, then in the long run, less likely to get bummed out for having a \"drug\" crutch.\n\nI like to think wizards and shamans don't feel much guilt when they smoke weed or smash shrooms.
